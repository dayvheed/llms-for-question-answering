Project Cost Overruns have become a growing concern due to the intricate nature of design and execution and maintaining the gross profit margin. The cost overruns factors impose a significant burden on both the public and private sectors, deliberately creating a disparity between planned and actual construction costs due to the financial and economic consequences on countries and the construction industry as a whole, along with negative effects on key stakeholders such as employers, consultants, and contractors. The analysis of global construction projects reveals that cost overruns have been a persistent issue for the past 70 years, lacking effective control or solutions. Studies have shown that construction projects experience an average of 28% cost overrun, and analysis conducted on several infrastructure projects indicates that cost overruns predominantly occur during the initial stages of design and planning, due to technical and administrative challenges.', 'question': 'Have cost overruns in the construction sector been effectively controlled in the past 70 years?', 'label': 'No'}, {'context': 'Cost overrun in construction refers to the situation where the actual costs incurred during a project exceed the initial budget or estimated costs agreed upon with the client. It is also referred to as a cost increase or budget overrun. This occurrence is typically attributed to underestimating the true cost of the project during the budgeting and project scoping phase. Various factors can contribute to cost overruns, which will be further explored in the subsequent section.', 'question': 'Is cost overrun the same as budget increase?', 'label': 'Yes'}, {'context': \"Several factors can significantly impact construction projects, potentially leading to delays and exceeding the budget. These factors range from material costs and labour shortages to other issues. The International Journal of Innovation, Management, and Technology highlights seven commonly identified causes of cost overrun in the construction industry: frequent design changes during the construction phase, contractors' financing issues, payment delays, lack of contractors' experience, poor cost estimation, poor tendering documents, and poor material management. These issues underline the complexity and the multi-faceted nature of managing construction projects.\", 'question': 'Does the International Journal of Innovation, Management, and Technology identify poor project management as a direct cause of cost overrun?', 'label': 'No'}, {'context': 'Frequent changes in design have become a common occurrence in the construction industry, with a significant number of incidents (up to 70%) attributed to design inconsistencies or errors. Identifying these design flaws during the construction process often requires contractors to issue change orders, which involve making necessary modifications or additions to the project after the initial models and budgets have been finalized. Several factors can lead to the need for change orders, including construction errors, omissions or errors in the design process, mistakes in fabrication, and revisions requested by the customer. Implementing these additional requirements often results in higher costs, causing the original project budget to exceed its initial estimation.', 'question': 'Are all design changes during construction due to customer requests?', 'label': 'No'}, {'context': 'Unlike other businesses that offer products or services in exchange for immediate payment, the construction industry operates differently. Contractors often receive payment after completing certain project milestones or even after the entire project is finished. This creates a unique financing challenge for contractors as they need to manage multiple projects and budgets simultaneously. They must ensure that they have enough funds available to cover project expenses and pay their workers, all while maintaining a continuous workflow and adhering to project timelines. This balancing act becomes even more challenging as approximately 25% of all projects experience significant scope expansion in the field, exceeding the initial project plans by over 30%.', 'question': 'Do all construction projects operate under a post-payment model?', 'label': 'No'}, {'context': 'In the construction industry, reputation is crucial. Being a trustworthy construction company means honouring commitments, adhering to designs and project scopes, and delivering projects within the agreed-upon timeline and budget. However, one of the challenges construction companies face is managing their cash flow effectively. With limited cash reserves, it can be difficult to make timely payments to subcontractors for the work they have completed. This creates a detrimental cycle where delayed payments to subcontractors make it harder for construction companies to meet project objectives, resulting in potential delays in project timelines.', 'question': \"Is timely payment to subcontractors not important for maintaining a construction company's reputation?\", 'label': 'No'}, {'context': 'Construction projects are becoming increasingly complex, requiring more time and specialized expertise to complete successfully. However, the industry is currently facing a significant challenge in the form of labour shortages. It is estimated that around 80% of construction companies are struggling to find qualified and experienced craft workers to fill crucial roles. The shortage of skilled labour has severe implications for construction projects. One of the main concerns is the increased risk of expensive rework. Without experienced contractors and workers, design errors and inconsistencies are more likely to occur, leading to the need for costly revisions and modifications.', 'question': 'Is the labor shortage in the construction industry leading to a decrease in project complexity?', 'label': 'No'}, {'context': 'The role of estimators in construction projects is crucial as they determine the anticipated resource expenditures based on project plans and specifications. However, this process is inherently complex and involves handling a large amount of interrelated cost and non-cost data. Complicating matters further, construction projects are often associated with a high level of uncertainty, and many unknown factors arise during the project execution phase.', 'question': 'Is the role of estimators considered minor in construction projects?', 'label': 'No'}, {'context': \"Tendering, or the bidding process, plays a significant role in construction projects by inviting subcontractors to participate. However, inadequate tendering documents have been identified as a root cause of cost overruns in several studies. This issue can be attributed to various factors such as miscommunication between contractor and designer, insufficient details and lack of coordination among relevant parties, limited human resources in design firms, and designer's lack of material and equipment knowledge.\", 'question': 'Are well-prepared tendering documents always sufficient to prevent cost overruns in construction projects?', 'label': 'No'}, {'context': 'Poor material management in construction projects can lead to significant inefficiencies and financial losses. Some of the consequences include waiting time for materials, lost productivity, increased costs, and inaccurate project budgeting. For example, inadequate planning or not knowing the availability of materials can result in delays as workers have to wait for the necessary materials to arrive. This waiting time can accumulate to as much as 80 minutes per day, reducing productivity and impacting project timelines.', 'question': 'Does efficient material management eliminate all forms of project delays in construction?', 'label': 'No'}, {'context': \"Maamawe, Growing Together City of Thunder Bay Strategic Plan 2023-2027: Goal: Strengthen the City's relationships with Indigenous communities, leaders and organizations to advance Truth & Reconciliation priorities together.

Although some expect blockchain technology to remove intermediaries, facilitating a direct relationship between artist and fan, initial findings are that intermediation in some form will remain. The article’s central focus is the crucial emerging role of these facilitator organizations – the new breed of financial intermediaries or ‘infomediaries’.

Much attention to date has focused on bitcoin (Nakamoto, 2008), yet bitcoin can be considered simply the first blockchain application. There are now well over a thousand cryptocurrencies, and numerous blockchains, the most significant for our purposes being Ethereum (Buterin, 2014). The security and real-time speed of blockchain transactions has attracted corporate interest, and notably IBM’s blockchain technology report claimed that 91% of banks were using this technology (IBM, 2017).

Financial intermediation, not necessarily for profit, may nurture skills development within new ventures. Yet financial intermediation also involves agency failures that can undermine more ‘utopian’ and altruistic aspirations. The GFC – what some might call the ultimate failure of financial intermediation, at least within the banking sector – clearly demonstrated that corporate shareholder demands and short-term, incentive-driven internal structures can undermine basic lending and investment principles and result in a backlash against riskier lending.', 'question': 'Is financial intermediation always conducted for profit according to the article?', 'label': 'No'}, {'context': 'Further to our discussion of the financing supply-side, we have noted the crucial axial role of infomediaries and the vital role that they can play in adding value to businesses, notably through upskilling and networking that can enable scale-up and attract new investors and sales markets (Baldock and Mason, 2015). From a resource-based view, Barney (1991) articulated the deficiencies of small young ventures’ management skills and knowledge base.

From a financing perspective, financial network theory (Uzzi, 1997, 1999) underlines this as a major barrier to obtaining external finance, leading to the human and social networking capital contention that entrepreneurs with less relevant business experience and suitable educational experience, and those from poorer backgrounds experience greatest barriers.', 'question': 'According to the article, do all new artist ventures successfully overcome financial skill gaps?', 'label': 'No'}, {'context': 'The crucial factor here is the degree of corporate intervention in the process and extent to which this is improving access to the market and distributing greater wealth to the originating artists, or simply re-enforcing the existing model (i.e. Pinna and Ruttenberg (2016) envisage corporate record labels clustering together to maintain the status quo cartel).

Identifying these design flaws during the construction process often requires contractors to issue change orders, which involve making necessary modifications or additions to the project after the initial models and budgets have been finalized. Several factors can lead to the need for change orders, including construction errors, omissions or errors in the design process, mistakes in fabrication, and revisions requested by the customer. Implementing these additional requirements often results in higher costs, causing the original project budget to exceed its initial estimation.', 'question': 'Are design changes during construction never due to customer requests?', 'label': 'No'}, {'context': 'Unlike other businesses that offer products or services in exchange for immediate payment, the construction industry operates differently. Contractors often receive payment after completing certain project milestones or even after the entire project is finished. This creates a unique financing challenge for contractors as they need to manage multiple projects and budgets simultaneously. They must ensure that they have enough funds available to cover project expenses and pay their workers, all while maintaining a continuous workflow and adhering to project timelines.

Although some expect blockchain technology to remove intermediaries, facilitating a direct relationship between artist and fan, initial findings are that intermediation in some form will remain. The article’s central focus is the crucial emerging role of these facilitator organizations – the new breed of financial intermediaries or ‘infomediaries’.

Much attention to date has focused on bitcoin (Nakamoto, 2008), yet bitcoin can be considered simply the first blockchain application. There are now well over a thousand cryptocurrencies, and numerous blockchains, the most significant for our purposes being Ethereum (Buterin, 2014).

Financial intermediation, not necessarily for profit, may nurture skills development within new ventures.
