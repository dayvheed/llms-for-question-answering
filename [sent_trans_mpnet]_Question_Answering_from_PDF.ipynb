The cost overruns factors impose a significant burden on both the public and private sectors, deliberately creating a disparity between planned and actual construction costs due to the financial and economic consequences on countries and the construction industry as a whole, along with negative effects on key stakeholders such as employers, consultants, and contractors. The analysis of global construction projects reveals that cost overruns have been a persistent issue for the past 70 years, lacking effective control or solutions. Studies have shown that construction projects experience an average of 28% cost overrun, and analysis conducted on several infrastructure projects indicates that cost overruns predominantly occur during the initial stages of design and planning, due to technical and administrative challenges.', 'question': 'Have cost overruns in the construction sector been effectively controlled in the past 70 years?', 'label': 'No'}, {'context': 'Cost overrun in construction refers to the situation where the actual costs incurred during a project exceed the initial budget or estimated costs agreed upon with the client.

These issues underline the complexity and the multi-faceted nature of managing construction projects.\", 'question': 'Does the International Journal of Innovation, Management, and Technology identify poor project management as a direct cause of cost overrun?', 'label': 'No'}, {'context': 'Frequent changes in design have become a common occurrence in the construction industry, with a significant number of incidents (up to 70%) attributed to design inconsistencies or errors. Identifying these design flaws during the construction process often requires contractors to issue change orders, which involve making necessary modifications or additions to the project after the initial models and budgets have been finalized. Several factors can lead to the need for change orders, including construction errors, omissions or errors in the design process, mistakes in fabrication, and revisions requested by the customer. Implementing these additional requirements often results in higher costs, causing the original project budget to exceed its initial estimation.', 'question': 'Are all design changes during construction due to customer requests?', 'label': 'No'}, {'context': 'Unlike other businesses that offer products or services in exchange for immediate payment, the construction industry operates differently. Contractors often receive payment after completing certain project milestones or even after the entire project is finished. This creates a unique financing challenge for contractors as they need to manage multiple projects and budgets simultaneously. They must ensure that they have enough funds available to cover project expenses and pay their workers, all while maintaining a continuous workflow and adhering to project timelines. This balancing act becomes even more challenging as approximately 25% of all projects experience significant scope expansion in the field, exceeding the initial project plans by over 30%.', 'question': 'Do all construction projects operate under a post-payment model?', 'label': 'No'}, {'context': 'In the construction industry, reputation is crucial. Being a trustworthy construction company means honouring commitments, adhering to designs and project scopes, and delivering projects within the agreed-upon timeline and budget. However, one of the challenges construction companies face is managing their cash flow effectively.

The shortage of skilled labour has severe implications for construction projects. One of the main concerns is the increased risk of expensive rework. Without experienced contractors and workers, design errors and inconsistencies are more likely to occur, leading to the need for costly revisions and modifications.', 'question': 'Is the labor shortage in the construction industry leading to a decrease in project complexity?', 'label': 'No'}, {'context': 'The role of estimators in construction projects is crucial as they determine the anticipated resource expenditures based on project plans and specifications.

We focus on the music industry, as an example of how alternative Internet-based finance utilizing blockchain could provide opportunities for start-up funding and ongoing revenue streams. Our pioneering pilot research findings are drawn from literature review and emerging case studies, and are grounded in the academic literature of start-up funding gaps. Although some expect blockchain technology to remove intermediaries, facilitating a direct relationship between artist and fan, initial findings are that intermediation in some form will remain. The article’s central focus is the crucial emerging role of these facilitator organizations – the new breed of financial intermediaries or ‘infomediaries’. We examine this evolving process through adoption and development of financial intermediation theory, exploring the wider financial intermediary concept of incubators and accelerators as expert investors and promoters of new and very early-stage ventures – including artists.', 'question': 'Does the article predict the complete elimination of intermediaries in blockchain finance within the music industry?', 'label': 'No'}, {'context': 'Blockchain technology is groundbreaking, even potentially revolutionary (Tapscott and Tapscott, 2018), primarily because it allows for the removal of third parties; no third parties, by contrast, have been removed in the shift, within the music industry, from physical (vinyl, cassette and compact disc) to digital formats (downloads and then streams). Much attention to date has focused on bitcoin (Nakamoto, 2008), yet bitcoin can be considered simply the first blockchain application. There are now well over a thousand cryptocurrencies, and numerous blockchains, the most significant for our purposes being Ethereum (Buterin, 2014). The security and real-time speed of blockchain transactions has attracted corporate interest, and notably IBM’s blockchain technology report claimed that 91% of banks were using this technology (IBM, 2017). IBM sets out a compelling case for how blockchain enables virtual, real-time purchase transactions underpinned by ‘smart contracts’ and secure permissions.', 'question': 'Does the article state that the shift from physical to digital formats in the music industry has involved the removal of intermediaries?', 'label': 'No'}, {'context': 'Financial intermediaries use their specialist skills to overcome aspects of information asymmetries to invest capital in the form of debt, equity or hybrid mezzanine structures into productive enterprises that require liquid assets to develop. In contemporary theory (Allen and Santomero, 1997), financial intermediaries have specialist investment skills – such as the early-stage sector knowledge of venture capitalists (Gompers, 1995) or lead angel investors within business angel syndicates (Mason and Harrison, 2015). This helps to overcome the information asymmetries that are frequently considered as the root cause of start-up and early-stage innovative and creative business finance gaps (Carpenter and Petersen, 2002; Fraser, 2011).', 'question': 'Do financial intermediaries only invest in established businesses?', 'label': 'No'}, {'context': 'For Scholtens and van Wensveen (2003), the reason for the survival and growth of financial intermediation fundamentally lies with value creation and the efficient optimization of private investment achieved through investment selection expertise, and through large-scale activities that absorb risk. In this article, we argue that this can be beneficial or detrimental – subject to appropriate checks and balances. Financial intermediation, not necessarily for profit, may nurture skills development within new ventures. Yet financial intermediation also involves agency failures that can undermine more ‘utopian’ and altruistic aspirations. The GFC – what some might call the ultimate failure of financial intermediation, at least within the banking sector – clearly demonstrated that corporate shareholder demands and short-term, incentive-driven internal structures can undermine basic lending and investment principles and result in a backlash against riskier lending.', 'question': 'Is financial intermediation always conducted for profit according to the article?', 'label': 'No'}, {'context': 'Further to our discussion of the financing supply-side, we have noted the crucial axial role of infomediaries and the vital role that they can play in adding value to businesses, notably through upskilling and networking that can enable scale-up and attract new investors and sales markets (Baldock and Mason, 2015). From a resource-based view, Barney (1991) articulated the deficiencies of small young ventures’ management skills and knowledge base. Furthermore, Fraser (2011) found that, within the United Kingdom, new artist ventures particularly struggle from lack of entrepreneurial and financial skills. From a financing perspective, financial network theory (Uzzi, 1997, 1999) underlines this as a major barrier to obtaining external finance, leading to the human and social networking capital contention that entrepreneurs with less relevant business experience and suitable educational experience, and those from poorer backgrounds experience greatest barriers.', 'question': 'According to the article, do all new artist ventures successfully overcome financial skill gaps?', 'label': 'No'}, {'context': 'The crucial factor here is the degree of corporate intervention in the process and extent to which this is improving access to the market and distributing greater wealth to the originating artists, or simply re-enforcing the existing model (i.e. Pinna and Ruttenberg (2016) envisage corporate record labels clustering together to maintain the status quo cartel). The foursquare model below provides a simplified framework presentation. From a ‘utopian’ perspective (represented in Table 2 by the box in the top left-hand corner), blockchain technology could be seen as providing a democratizing framework for valuation whereby individuals can offer their services and products globally and receive payments in real time via smart contracts. Consider Backfeed, an initiative using blockchain technology to encourage massive, open-source collaboration between peers without centralized control.', 'question': 'Does the article suggest that all corporate interventions in blockchain technology are negative?', 'label': 'No'}, {'context': 'The other ‘utopian’ possibility is that corporates support P2P networks (top right-hand corner in Table 2), but their power is reduced due to the partial disintermediation offered by blockchain technology.

By enabling participating organizations to insert, update and remove their own information, this is a step towards a public rights database and offers an immutable audit trail – potentially leading to far more rapid and efficient distribution of, for example, royalty rights and streaming payments to artists.', 'question': \"Is Jaak's KORD network an example of complete disintermediation in the music industry?\", 'label': 'No'}, {'context': 'It is possible that within a relatively short period of time, there will be multiple hybrid forms of emerging artists using traditional and new forms of finance, but that they will increasingly be drawn towards the global streaming markets and associated support services offered by blockchain streaming/licensing/publishing intermediaries (e.g. SingularDTV music ecosystem services).

We focus on the music industry, as an example of how alternative Internet-based finance utilizing blockchain could provide opportunities for start-up funding and ongoing revenue streams. Our pioneering pilot research findings are drawn from literature review and emerging case studies, and are grounded in the academic literature of start-up funding gaps. Although some expect blockchain technology to remove intermediaries, facilitating a direct relationship between artist and fan, initial findings are that intermediation in some form will remain. The article’s central focus is the crucial emerging role of these facilitator organizations – the new breed of financial intermediaries or ‘infomediaries’. We examine this evolving process through adoption and development of financial intermediation theory, exploring the wider financial intermediary concept of incubators and accelerators as expert investors and promoters of new and very early-stage ventures – including artists.', 'question': 'Does the article predict the complete removal of intermediaries in blockchain finance within the music industry?', 'label': 'No'}, {'context': 'Blockchain technology is groundbreaking, even potentially revolutionary (Tapscott and Tapscott, 2018), primarily because it allows for the removal of third parties; no third parties, by contrast, have been removed in the shift, within the music industry, from physical (vinyl, cassette and compact disc) to digital formats (downloads and then streams). Much attention to date has focused on bitcoin (Nakamoto, 2008), yet bitcoin can be considered simply the first blockchain application. There are now well over a thousand cryptocurrencies, and numerous blockchains, the most significant for our purposes being Ethereum (Buterin, 2014). The security and real-time speed of blockchain transactions has attracted corporate interest, and notably IBM’s blockchain technology report claimed that 91% of banks were using this technology (IBM, 2017).

In this article, we argue that this can be beneficial or detrimental – subject to appropriate checks and balances. Financial intermediation, not necessarily for profit, may nurture skills development within new ventures. Yet financial intermediation also involves agency failures that can undermine more ‘utopian’ and altruistic aspirations. The GFC – what some might call the ultimate failure of financial intermediation, at least within the banking sector – clearly demonstrated that corporate shareholder demands and short-term, incentive-driven internal structures can undermine basic lending and investment principles and result in a backlash against riskier lending.', 'question': 'Is financial intermediation never conducted for profit according to the article?', 'label': 'No'}, {'context': 'Further to our discussion of the financing supply-side, we have noted the crucial axial role of infomediaries and the vital role that they can play in adding value to businesses, notably through upskilling and networking that can enable scale-up and attract new investors and sales markets (Baldock and Mason, 2015). From a resource-based view, Barney (1991) articulated the deficiencies of small young ventures’ management skills and knowledge base. Furthermore, Fraser (2011) found that, within the United Kingdom, new artist ventures particularly struggle from lack of entrepreneurial and financial skills. From a financing perspective, financial network theory (Uzzi, 1997, 1999) underlines this as a major barrier to obtaining external finance, leading to the human and social networking capital contention that entrepreneurs with less relevant business experience and suitable educational experience, and those from poorer backgrounds experience greatest barriers.', 'question': 'According to the article, do some new artist ventures struggle to overcome financial skill gaps?', 'label': 'Yes'}, {'context': 'The other ‘utopian’ possibility is that corporates support P2P networks (top right-hand corner in Table 2), but their power is reduced due to the partial disintermediation offered by blockchain technology.
